## Project Aim
This data story investigates the reality behind Mega Millions jackpots through data scraping, analysis, and visualization. The project reveals the significant discrepancy between advertised jackpot amounts and what winners actually receive, exposing a concerning pattern in lottery marketing.

## Key Findings
Analysis of the past five years' data reveals that lottery winners who opt for immediate cash payout typically receive only 50-60% of the advertised jackpot amount. This creates a substantial gap between headline-grabbing jackpot figures and the actual sums awarded to winners, raising questions about lottery advertising practices.

## Data Collection & Methodology
The dataset was created by:
1. Scraping Mega Millions data using Python's Beautiful Soup library
2. Cleaning and processing the data with pandas, including:
   - Converting date formats from text to numerical values
   - Standardizing monetary values by replacing terms like "billion" and "million" with numerical equivalents
3. Visualizing the data using R
4. Finalizing visualizations with Adobe Illustrator and implementing ai2html for responsive design across web and mobile platforms

## Technical Growth & Skills Development
This project involved implementing ai2html for the first time, enabling responsive data visualizations that adapt seamlessly to different devices. This approach significantly improves accessibility for readers across various platforms while maintaining visual integrity.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Collection**: Python (Beautiful Soup)
- **Data Processing**: Python (pandas)
- **Data Visualization**: R, Adobe Illustrator
- **Web Implementation**: ai2html

## AI Assistance
Code, HTML, and visualizations were created independently. Claude was used for copy editing and to resolve technical errors.
